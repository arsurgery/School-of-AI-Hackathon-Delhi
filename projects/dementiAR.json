    "description": "It's normal to forget things from time to time, and it's normal to become somewhat more forgetful as you age. But how much forgetfulness is too much? How can you tell whether your memory lapses are normal forgetfulness and within the scope of normal ageing or are a symptom of something more serious? \n Healthy people can experience memory loss or memory distortion at any age. Some of these memory flaws become more pronounced with age, but — unless they are extreme and \n persistent — they are not considered indicators of Alzheimer's or other memory-impairing illnesses. \n We plan to build up a smart assistant for people suffering from memory-impairing illnesses like Agnosia, Alzheimer's disease, Wernicke- Korsakoff's syndrome, impaired short term memory, etc. using the power of advanced technology like Deep Learning and Augmented Reality.",
